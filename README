Service to toggle between Test code directory tree and Source code directory tree

Requirements:
				Mac OSX (tested only on Lion)
				PHP (tested only on 5.5)
				command line tools (install through x-code)

Installation:
	1) Copy "Toggle Tests-Source.workflow" to "~/Library/Services".
	2) Assign keyboard shortcut to service in
		"System Preferences"->"Keyboard"->"Keyboard Shortcuts"->"Services"->"Files and Folders"->"Toggle Tests-Source".
		I suggest using [control+t]
	3) Run the service at least once through "Finder"->"Services"->"Toggle Tests-Source"
		(They keyboard shortcut might not work before this)

Usage:

Organize your test files in a directory tree that mirrors that of your source directory tree.

If you are in a source directory that doesn't have a corresponding test directory yet or vice versa, the directory will be created.

	Usage Example:
		All your source code files originate from the folder
			/Users/userName/Documents/Dropbox/WebServer/**framework**/
		All your test files originate from the folder
			/Users/userName/Documents/Dropbox/WebServer/**frameworkTest**/

		If you create a source code file
			/Users/userName/Documents/Dropbox/WebServer/**framework**/fw_library/db/wrapper/MySQL.php
		the test file lives in
			/Users/userName/Documents/Dropbox/WebServer/**frameworkTest**/fw_library/db/wrapper/MySQL.php

		Now in the folder /Users/userName/Documents/Dropbox/WebServer/**framework**/fw_library/db/wrapper you can hit [control+t], and the finder window will navigate to /Users/userName/Documents/Dropbox/WebServer/**frameworkTest**/fw_library/db/wrapper. If you hit [control+t] again, you will go back to the original folder.
