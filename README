A Service for Mac OSX to toggle between Test code directory tree
and Source code directory tree.

Requirements:
	Mac OSX (tested only on Lion)
	PHP (tested only on 5.5)
	command line tools (install through x-code)

Installation:
1)  Open "Toggle Tests-Source.workflow" and select "Install" or
	copy "Toggle Tests-Source.workflow" to "~/Library/Services"

2) 	Assign keyboard shortcut to service in
	"System Preferences"->"Keyboard"->"Keyboard Shortcuts"->
	"Services"->"Files and Folders"->"Toggle Tests-Source".

	I suggest using [control+t]

3) 	Run the service at least once through "Finder"->"Services"->
	"Toggle Tests-Source"
	(They keyboard shortcut might not work before this)

Usage:

Organize your test files in a directory tree that mirrors that of your source directory tree.

If you are in a source directory that doesn't have a corresponding test directory yet
or vice versa, the service will create and open the corresponding directory.

Usage Example:
	All your source code files originate from the folder
		/Users/userName/WebServer/framework/
	All your test files originate from the folder
		/Users/userName/WebServer/frameworkTest/

	If you create a source code file named:
		/Users/userName/WebServer/framework/fw_library/db/wrapper/MySQL.php
	the corresponding test file will be:
		/Users/userName/WebServer/frameworkTest/fw_library/db/wrapper/MySQLTest.php

	Now in the folder
	/Users/userName/WebServer/framework/fw_library/db/wrapper
	you can hit [control+t], and the finder window will navigate to /Users/userName/WebServer/frameworkTest/fw_library/db/wrapper.
	If you hit [control+t] again, you will go back to the original folder.
